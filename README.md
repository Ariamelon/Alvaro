 Pro Micro-compatible 32u4 Breakout Board

## Disclaimer
This board is a heavily-modified [Goldfish Rev. C](https://github.com/staticintlucas/Goldfish). While the schematic, basic layout, pinout (of course) etc is essentially the same, it uses 0603 components instead of 0402 and has some other changes.

## Key Features
* Mid-mount USB-C connector using a low-profile USB C 2.0 connector.
* Pin-compatible with the original Pro Micro.
* 5 extra pins on the bottom like the Elite-C and Goldfish.
* Exposed USB data lines on 2.54mm grid.
* Easier to solder than the Goldfish.
* Has fuse unlike Goldfish.
